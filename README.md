# python-practice

This repo is an ongoing collection of my Python practice projects. I'm currently using [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/) as my primary source for learning! As I continue to develop my understanding of the language, I'll be working on progressively advancing small projects to reinforce and strengthen the skill.

## Navigation
As the repo expands, it will be organized by folders of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced).

This is the current chronological list of projects:
|   | Project | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Integer Whisperer](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/tree/main/integer-whisperer) | A simple cli app which analyzes the prime status of user-provided integer |
| 2 | [Collatz Sequence](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/tree/main/collatz_sequence) | A simple cli app which performs the collatz sequence on a user-provided integer \(taken from [ATBS](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/chapter4.html#:~:text=the%20following%20tasks.-,The%20Collatz%20Sequence,-Write%20a%20function)\)|
| 3 | [Strong Password Checker](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/blob/main/regex_programs/checker.py) | A simple cli app which outputs whether a password is strong \(taken from [ATBS](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/chapter9.html#:~:text=Strong%20Password%20Detection)\) |
| 4 | [String Strip](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/blob/main/regex_programs/strip.py) | A simple cli app which strips a string of whitespace or specified characters \(taken from [ATBS](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/chapter9.html#:~:text=Regex%20Version%20of%20the%20strip()%20Method)\) |

## Installation
1.	Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice.git`
2.	Navigate to the project folder
3.	Run the main script in terminal (try any appropriate one of these commands)
    ```python
    python [mainscript].py   #works for mac, windows, linux
    py [mainscript].py       #works for windows
    python3 [mainscript].py  #works for mac, Linux
    
    #if using ide, you can also use ide shortcut instead of terminal (e.g. F5 in Vs Code)

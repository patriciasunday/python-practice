**# python-practice**



This repo is an ongoing collection of my Python practice projects. I'm currently using \[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/) as my primary source for learning! As I continue to develop my understanding of the language, I'll be working on progressively advancing small projects to reinforce and strengthen the skill.





**## Navigation**

As the repo expands, it will be organized by folders of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced).



**This is the current chronological list of projects**:

|   | project | description |

|---|---------|-------------|

| 1 | Integer Whisperer | simple cli app which analyzes the prime status of user-provided integer |

| 2 | tbd | tbd |







**## Installation**

1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice.git`
2. **Navigate to the project folder**
3. **Run the main script in terminal** (try any appropriate one of these commands)

&nbsp;   ```python

&nbsp;   python \[mainscript].py   #works for mac, windows, linux

&nbsp;   py \[mainscript].py       #works for windows

&nbsp;   python3 \[mainscript].py  #works for mac, Linux

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   #if using ide, you can also use ide shortcut instead of terminal (e.g. F5 in Vs Code)

&nbsp;   ```



*>* \*\*Note\*\*: Main script is always at a project's root

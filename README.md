# **python-practice**



This repo is an ongoing collection of my Python practice projects. I'm currently using Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Textbook as my primary source for learning! As I continue to develop my understanding of the language, I'll be working on progressively advancing small projects to reinforce and strengthen the skill.



### **Navigation**

As the repo expands, it will be organized by folders of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced).



**This is the current chronological list of projects**:

|   | project | description |

|---|---------|-------------|

| 1 | Integer Whisperer | simple cli app which analyzes the prime status of user-provided integer |

|---|---------|-------------|

| 2 | tbd | tbd |

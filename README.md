# python-practice

This repo is an ongoing collection of my Python practice projects. I'm currently using [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/) as my primary source for learning! As I continue to develop my understanding of the language, I'll be working on progressively advancing small projects to reinforce and strengthen the skill.

## Navigation
As the repo expands, it will be organized by folders of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate, Advanced).

This is the current chronological list of projects:
|   | Project | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [Integer Whisperer](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/tree/main/integer-whisperer) | A simple cli app which analyzes the prime status of user-provided integer |
| 2 | [Collatz Sequence](https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice/tree/main/collatz_sequence) | A simple cli app which performs the [collatz sequence](https://www.collatztool.com/) on a user-provided integer |

## Installation
1.	Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/patriciasunday/python-practice.git`
2.	Navigate to the project folder
3.	Run the main script in terminal (try any appropriate one of these commands)
    ```python

# **python-practice**



This repo is an ongoing collection of my Python practice projects. I'm currently using Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Textbook as my primary source for learning! As I continue to develop my understanding of the language, I'll be working on progressively advancing small projects to reinforce and strengthen the skill.
